# Contributing

## What can you do?

* Organise my notes, atomise the documents into folders so that it's easier to look things up when I actually write a draft
* Suggest your own ideas
* Correct my spelling and grammar
* Suggest balance tweaks
* Improve the layout
* Translate \(I wouldn't bother with notes\)

## Please don't do these:

* delete stuff \(unless you have copied it to another location in the repo or it was a dupulicate\)
* vandalise
