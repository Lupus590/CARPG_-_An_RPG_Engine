#Introduction

This yet to be named pen and paper RPG engine aims to be detailed, (mostly) realistic, flexible (class-less), and (hopefully) simple.

It will first be designed for fantasy settings, but sci-fi and modern will be included.

For those reading this on github, this is a non-code project.

This project will be best viewed using [gitbook](http://www.gitbook.com) until I export it.
