#armour, clothing jullery
* one size *does not* always fit all
* different items effect stats in different ways:
 * clothing and jullery has no effect on stats, but provides no armour
 * light armour has little penalty to stats, but provides some damage resistance
 * heavy armour has more effect on stats, but provides the most damage resistance
 * Enchantments can change anything
 * Armour has HP and takes full damage but reduces and changes damage type



#weapons
different weapons behave in different ways, but the training of the character is the major factor

#combat
combat time makes the assumption that the character has dropped their bags. characters can get penitles if they keep their bags during combat time.

#item access and location
Assessing items in a bag generally takes longer than those on your person, however bags can carry both more items and larger items. 

Equipment has stat requirements, not meeting the required stats reduces effectiveness and/or prevents special action with that equipment.

#slots
##clothing, armour and jullery
* head
 * face
  * eyes
  * mouth

* hand

##equipment/items/weapons
* back
* waist
* chest
* (the following are separate for left an right, but only have one entry)
* calf
* forearm
* upper-arm
* thigh
* any equipment not in one of these slots or currently held is considered to be inside of or attached to the character's bag
* your bag/s will take one or more of these slots

equipment has a weight and a volume, volume is usually a lesser issue as it only applies for containers (such as your bag)

some things may use multiple slots at the same time, others may be able to go in many slots but only use one of the slots chosen

the weight and volume of your equipment will have different effects on your character, depending on your stats and the weight/volume.
