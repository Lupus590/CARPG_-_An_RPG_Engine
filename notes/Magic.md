multiple ways of casting? runes, staves

runes and staves are foci, catalysts and/or conduits

everyone has some magic ability

magic is stored in wells which fill from the environment over time. Emptying your well (also known as over-drawing) is usually painful and can be deadly.

#3 types of magic?
* inercio - energy
* ??? - mass
* cognita - intelligence

different spells cost different amounts of each component

example spell: homing friendly fireball
* homing = intelligence and energy
* friendly = intelligence
* fire = energy
* projectile (ball) = mass and energy

Every one has a magic pool, life points can be used as overdraw.

Everybody pool rarely changes in size. All spells are unlocked from the start, but not all will be cast-able from level one. Instead spells get cheaper to cast, some spells can be super charged to increase effects.


#Magic is a science
From the sorcerers apprentice (film)
* "is this science or magic?"
* "both, if you want to set something on fire, you vibrate its molecules until so that they produce heat. Eventually it will combust."

tech is just automated magic
science, tech and magic http://www.springhole.net/writing/mix-science-and-magic.htm

magic is left overs from when the universe was made

#chi or ninja movie magic

* Wizards have a limited number of spells in their spellbook, from which they prepare which spells they have access to for the day, and they have a certain number of slots per level to cast them.
* Clerics have all the cleric spells to choose from to decide what to prepare, plus their domain spells they always have prepared, with a limited number of spell slots per level to cast them.
* Druids operate similarly to Clerics, but use their circles instead of domains.
* Sorcerers have a limited number of spells, which are all always prepared, and they have a certain number of slots per level to cast them. They also have spell points to regain spells or use other abilities, and they can burn spell slots to gain more spell points.
* Warlocks have an extremely limited number of spells, which are all always prepared, and a very limited number of slots (all used at their highest level) to cast them. However, they regain their spell slots during either a short or long rest. They also are likely to get a number of other spells from their pacts, invocations, and so on.
* Paladins cast spells like a Cleric.
* Rangers cast spells like Druids.
* Bards, Rogue Arcane Tricksters, and Fighter Eldritch Knights work like Sorcerers, without the spell points.
* Barbarians don’t cast spells. You’ll just have to settle for raging.
