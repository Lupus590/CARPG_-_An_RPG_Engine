god aspects? http://thaumcraft-4.wikia.com/wiki/Aspects http://ftbwiki.org/List_of_Aspects_%28Thaumcraft_4.2%29

Gods have holy days, clerics get a bonus on these days.

Actions made by the player characters may please one god and displease another. PCs in good standing with a god may ask for miricals, this lowers the favour of the god but can grant the player unique benefits. Miricals may even save a party from a team wipe.

Gods who are friends with your God will be more inclined to like you
