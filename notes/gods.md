god aspects? http://thaumcraft-4.wikia.com/wiki/Aspects http://ftbwiki.org/List_of_Aspects_%28Thaumcraft_4.2%29

Gods have holy days, clerics get a bonus on these days.

Actions made by the player characters may please one god and displease another. PCs in good standing with a god may ask for miricals, this lowers the favor of the god but can grant the player unique beifits. Miricals may even save a party from a team wipe.
