try to have high customization during off time (character creation/advancement and world building), but fast pace combat/narrative/gameplay when players actually meet

avoid 'master' for the GM/DM - guide is better, this is to avoid players asking the GM for permission to do things (if it's in the book, it can be done) encourage the GM to be on the players side, rolling openly and not hiding NPC stats helps with this. Note: Hiding rolls and stats does allow the GM to fudge, which can allow better narratives.

Spirits and bodies should work nicely with separated attribute system

#which dice system?
d10? d20? d6? I'm planning on this being a roll20 rpg more than a table top one, so I'm not limited to real dice

#Wishes made with a last breath
When a PC or an important NPC is about to die they can perform an amazing action. This last act is designed to allow the near dead to save their allies, but it can be used to do almost anything.


RPG where meta gaming is not only allowed but encouraged and lore?
