fuzzy logic on stats?






values
  works simular to morals
  things pc will try to do  get or keep
  
morality - catagorise acts
  won't have a second thought: 
  uncomfortable doing: i would like this to go unknown
  doing this will haunt me for the rest of my days
  i would rather torture and death than doing this

value of people - these are general rules, some people may be valued differently due to a more complex relationship (ally/rival)
  purely selfless: always thinks of how acts will help others (these others may be everyone, a guild or city, or the rest of the party), may forget there own needs/wants
  mostly selfless: always thinks of others, but not to the point of self abandonment
  equal: others are neither above or below them. happy to give as much as receive
  whats in it for me: willing to help others but may need encouragement
  purly selfish: keeps to their own issues, only helps others if they see it helping themselves in the future "not my problem"
  
  
  
  
  
  

try to have high customization during off time (character creation/advancement and world building), but fast pace combat/narrative/gameplay when players actually meet

avoid 'master' for the GM/DM - guide is better, this is to avoid players asking the GM for permission to do things (if it's in the book, it can be done) encourage the GM to be on the players side, rolling openly and not hiding NPC stats helps with this. Note: Hiding rolls and stats does allow the GM to fudge, which can allow better narratives.

Spirits and bodies should work nicely with separated attribute system

#which dice system?
d10? d20? d6? I'm planning on this being a roll20 rpg more than a table top one, so I'm not limited to real dice

explain dice and dice notation

#Wishes made with a last breath
When a PC or an important NPC is about to die they can perform an amazing action. This last act is designed to allow the near dead to save their allies, but it can be used to do almost anything.


RPG where meta gaming is not only allowed but encouraged and lore?
